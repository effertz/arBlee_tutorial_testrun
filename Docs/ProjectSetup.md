# Project Setup

There are a few things needed to setup a **project for a mobile application** with Unity. The following instructions will guide you through them.

### For iOS:

1. In Unity Editor go to *File* → *Build Settings*, select *iOS* from the platform list below and press *Switch Platform*. Wait for the switch to complete and close the *Build Settings* dialog. From now you will be building for your iPhone.
2. Go to *Edit* → *Project Settings* → *Player* and enter your *Product Name* and C*ompany Name*. These can be really anything, but try to be somewhat unique. Next select *iOS* tab and *Other Settings*: make sure that *Auto Graphics API* is enabled. Set *Bundle Identifier* to *com.your Company Name.your Product Name* or anything else unique.

### For Android:
For **Android setup** follow the tutorial on [Unity learn](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/building-for-mobile).
