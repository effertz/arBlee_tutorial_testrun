# Prerequisites

Check the official [System requirements for Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.1/Documentation/Manual/system-requirements.html) page on Unity docs.

Make sure you have **enough space** available. For example, for a setup on Mac with iPhone you will need:
- 11 GB for Unity Editor and
    - 1.6 GB for iOS Build Support Module 
    - 5.9 GB for Android Build Support Module
- 15 GB for XCode
- 1.4 GB for Visual Studio

The project itself is not that big:
- 500 MB for source code
- 500 MB for the build folder
- 60 MB for the app on iPhone
