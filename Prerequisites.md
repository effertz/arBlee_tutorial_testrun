# Prerequisites

Check the official [System requirements for Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.1/Documentation/Manual/system-requirements.html) page on Unity docs.

Also, make sure that you have **enough space** available. For example for a setup on Mac with iPhone you will need:
- 7 GB for Unity Editor
- 15 GB for XCode
- 1.4 GB for Visual Studio

The project itself is not that big:
- 500 MB for source code
- 500 MB for the build folder
- 60MB for the app on iPhone
